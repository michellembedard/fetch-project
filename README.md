# fetch-project

## Part 1: explore the data
- Review the unstructured csv files and answer the following questions with code that supports your conclusions:
1. Are there any data quality issues present?
2. Are there any fields that are challenging to understand?

## Part 2: provide SQL queries
- Answer three of the following questions with at least one question coming from the closed-ended and one from the open-ended question set. Each question should be answered using one query.
### 2A Closed-ended questions:
1. What are the top 5 brands by receipts scanned among users 21 and over?
2. What are the top 5 brands by sales among users that have had their 3. account for at least six months?
3. What is the percentage of sales in the Health & Wellness category by generation?
### 2B Open-ended questions: for these, make assumptions and clearly state them when answering the question.
1. Who are Fetchâ€™s power users?
2. Which is the leading brand in the Dips & Salsa category?
3. At what percent has Fetch grown year over year?

## Part 3: communicate with stakeholders
- Construct an email or slack message that is understandable to a product or business leader who is not familiar with your day-to-day work. Summarize the results of your investigation. Include:
    - Key data quality issues and outstanding questions about the data
    - One interesting trend in the data
        - Use a finding from part 2 or come up with a new insight
    - Request for action: explain what additional help, info, etc. you need to make sense of the data and resolve any outstanding issues
